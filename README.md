# rational

Package `rational` brings rational [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number), [split-complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-complex_number), and [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number) numbers to Go. It borrows heavily from the `math`, `math/cmplx`, and `math/big` packages. Indeed, it is built on top of the `big.Rat` type.

## Two-Dimensional Types

There are three two-dimensional types. The (binary) multiplication operation for all two-dimensional types is **commutative** and **associative**.

### rational.Complex

The `rational.Complex` type represents a rational complex number. It corresponds to a complex Cayley-Dickson construct with `big.Rat` values. The imaginary unit element is denoted `i`. The multiplication rule is:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = -1
```
This type can be used to study [Gaussian integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integer).

### rational.Perplex

The `rational.Perplex` type represents a rational perplex number. It corresponds to a perplex Cayley-Dickson construct with `big.Rat` values. The split unit element is denoted `s`. The multiplication rule is:
```go
	Mul(s, s) = +1
```
Perplex numbers are more commonly known as [split-complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-complex_number), but "perplex" is used here for brevity and symmetry with "complex".

### rational.Infra

The `rational.Infra` type represents a rational infra number. It corresponds to a null Cayley-Dickson construct with `big.Rat` values. The dual unit element is denoted `α`. The multiplication rule is:
```go
	Mul(α, α) = 0
```
Infra numbers are more commonly known as [dual numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number), but "infra" is used here along with "supra" and "ultra" for the higher-dimensional analogs.

## Four-Dimensional Types

There are five four-dimensional types. The (binary) multiplication operation for all four-dimensional types is **noncommutative** but **associative**.

### rational.Hamilton

The `rational.Hamilton` type represents a rational Hamilton quaternion. It corresponds to a complex Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Complex` values. The imaginary unit elements are denoted `i`, `j`, and `k`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = Mul(j, j) = Mul(k, k) = -1
	Mul(i, j) = -Mul(j, i) = k
	Mul(j, k) = -Mul(k, j) = i
	Mul(k, i) = -Mul(i, k) = j
```
Hamilton quaternions are [traditional quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion). The type is named after W.R. Hamilton, who discovered quaternions.

This type can be used to study [Hurwitz and Lipschitz integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz_quaternion).

### rational.Cockle

The `rational.Cockle` type represents a rational Cockle quaternion. It corresponds to a perplex Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Complex` values. The imaginary unit element is denoted `i`, and the split unit elements are denoted `t` and `u`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = -1
	Mul(t, t) = Mul(u, u) = +1
	Mul(i, t) = -Mul(t, i) = u
	Mul(u, t) = -Mul(t, u) = i
	Mul(u, i) = -Mul(i, u) = t
```
Cockle quaternions are more commonly known as [split-quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-quaternion). The type is named after J. Cockle, who discovered them.

### rational.Supra

The `rational.Supra` type represents a rational supra number. It corresponds to a null Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Infra` values. The dual unit elements are denoted `α`, `β`, and `γ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(α, α) = Mul(β, β) = Mul(γ, γ) = 0
	Mul(α, β) = -Mul(β, α) = γ
	Mul(β, γ) = Mul(γ, β) = 0
	Mul(γ, α) = Mul(α, γ) = 0
```
Note that supra numbers are very different from [hyper-dual numbers](http://adl.stanford.edu/hyperdual/): the multiplication operation for supra numbers is noncommutative. In some ways, supra numbers are the dual analog of quaternions.

### rational.InfraComplex

The `rational.InfraComplex` type represents a rational infra complex number. It corresponds to a null Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Complex` values. The imaginary unit element is denoted `i`, and the dual unit elements are denoted `β` and `γ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = -1
	Mul(β, β) = Mul(γ, γ) = 0
	Mul(β, γ) = Mul(γ, β) = 0
	Mul(i, β) = -Mul(β, i) = γ
	Mul(γ, i) = -Mul(i, γ) = β
```
Note that `i` does not commute with either `β` or `γ`.

### rational.InfraPerplex

The `rational.InfraPerplex` type represents a rational infra perplex number. It corresponds to a null Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Perplex` values. The split unit element is denoted `s`, and the dual unit elements are denoted `τ` and `υ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(s, s) = +1
	Mul(τ, τ) = Mul(υ, υ) = 0
	Mul(τ, υ) = Mul(υ, τ) = 0
	Mul(s, τ) = -Mul(τ, s) = υ
	Mul(s, υ) = -Mul(υ, s) = τ
```
Like `i` in the infra complex numbers, `s` does not commute with either `τ` or `υ`.

## Eight-Dimensional Types

There are seven eight-dimensional types. The (binary) multiplication operation for all eight-dimensional types is **noncommutative** and **nonassociative**.

### rational.Cayley

The `rational.Cayley` type represents a rational Cayley octonion. It corresponds to a complex Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Hamilton` values. The imaginary unit elements are denoted `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `p`, and `q`.

Cayley octonions are [traditional octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion). The type is named after A. Cayley, who was **not** the first person to discover octonions. The first person to discover octonions was J.T. Graves.

### rational.Zorn

The `rational.Zorn` type represents a rational Zorn octonion. It corresponds to a perplex Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Hamilton` values. The imaginary unit elements are denoted `i`, `j`, and `k`, and the split unit elements are `r`, `s`, `t`, and `u`.

Zorn octonions are commonly known as [split-octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-octonion). The type is named after M.A. Zorn, who developed a vector-matrix algebra for working with split-octonions.

### rational.Ultra

The `rational.Ultra` type represents a rational ultra number. It corresponds to a null Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Supra` values. The dual unit elements are denoted `α`, `β`, `γ`, `δ`, `ε`, `ζ`, and `η`.

In some ways, ultra numbers are the dual analog of octonions.

### rational.InfraHamilton

The `rational.InfraHamilton` type represents a rational infra Hamilton quaternion. It corresponds to a null Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Hamilton` values. The imaginary unit elements are denoted `i`, `j` and `k`, and the dual unit elements are denoted `α`, `β`, `γ`, and `δ`.

### rational.InfraCockle

The `rational.InfraCockle` type represents a rational infra Cockle quaternion. It corresponds to a null Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Cockle` values. The imaginary unit element is denoted `i`, the split unit elements are denoted `t` and `u`, and the dual unit elements are denoted `ρ`, `σ`, `τ`, and `υ`.

### rational.SupraComplex

The `rational.SupraComplex` type represents a rational supra complex number. It corresponds to a null Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.InfraComplex` values. The imaginary unit element is denoted `i`, and the dual unit elements are denoted `α`, `β`, `γ`, `δ`, `ε`, and `ζ`.

### rational.SupraPerplex

The `rational.SupraPerplex` type represents a rational supra perplex number. It corresponds to a null Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.InfraPerplex` values. The split unit element is denoted `s`, and the dual unit elements are denoted `ρ`, `σ`, `τ`, `υ`, `φ`, and `ψ`.
