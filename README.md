# rational

Package `rational` brings rational [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number), [split-complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-complex_number), and [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number) numbers to Go. It borrows heavily from the `math`, `math/cmplx`, and `math/big` packages. Indeed, it is built on top of the `big.Rat` type.

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/gojp/goreportcard)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/meirizarrygelpi/rational) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/meirizarrygelpi/rational?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/meirizarrygelpi/rational)

This package contains three two-dimensional types (e.g. complex numbers), five four-dimensional types (e.g. quaternions), and seven eight-dimensional types (e.g. octonions).

## Two-Dimensional Types

There are three two-dimensional types. The (binary) multiplication operation for all two-dimensional types is **commutative** and **associative**.

### rational.Complex

The `rational.Complex` type represents a rational complex number. It corresponds to an elliptic Cayley-Dickson construct with `big.Rat` values. The imaginary unit element is denoted `i`. The multiplication rule is:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = -1
```
This type can be used to study [Gaussian integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integer).

### rational.Perplex

The `rational.Perplex` type represents a rational perplex number. It corresponds to a hyperbolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `big.Rat` values. The split unit element is denoted `s`. The multiplication rule is:
```go
	Mul(s, s) = +1
```
Perplex numbers are more commonly known as [split-complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-complex_number), but "perplex" is used here for brevity and symmetry with "complex".

### rational.Infra

The `rational.Infra` type represents a rational infra number. It corresponds to a parabolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `big.Rat` values. The dual unit element is denoted `α`. The multiplication rule is:
```go
	Mul(α, α) = 0
```
Infra numbers are more commonly known as [dual numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number), but "infra" is used here along with "supra" and "ultra" for the higher-dimensional analogs.

## Four-Dimensional Types

There are five four-dimensional types. The (binary) multiplication operation for all four-dimensional types is **noncommutative** but **associative**.

### rational.Hamilton

The `rational.Hamilton` type represents a rational Hamilton quaternion. It corresponds to an elliptic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Complex` values. The imaginary unit elements are denoted `i`, `j`, and `k`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = Mul(j, j) = Mul(k, k) = -1
	Mul(i, j) = -Mul(j, i) = k
	Mul(j, k) = -Mul(k, j) = i
	Mul(k, i) = -Mul(i, k) = j
```
Hamilton quaternions are [traditional quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion). The type is named after W.R. Hamilton, who discovered quaternions.

This type can be used to study [Hurwitz and Lipschitz integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz_quaternion).

### rational.Cockle

The `rational.Cockle` type represents a rational Cockle quaternion. It corresponds to a hyperbolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Complex` values. The imaginary unit element is denoted `i`, and the split unit elements are denoted `t` and `u`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = -1
	Mul(t, t) = Mul(u, u) = +1
	Mul(i, t) = -Mul(t, i) = u
	Mul(u, t) = -Mul(t, u) = i
	Mul(u, i) = -Mul(i, u) = t
```
Cockle quaternions are more commonly known as [split-quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-quaternion). The type is named after J. Cockle, who discovered them.

Alternatively, you can obtain the Cockle quaternions from an *elliptic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Perplex` values; or from a *hyperbolic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Perplex` values.

### rational.Supra

The `rational.Supra` type represents a rational supra number. It corresponds to a parabolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Infra` values. The dual unit elements are denoted `α`, `β`, and `γ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(α, α) = Mul(β, β) = Mul(γ, γ) = 0
	Mul(α, β) = -Mul(β, α) = γ
	Mul(β, γ) = Mul(γ, β) = 0
	Mul(γ, α) = Mul(α, γ) = 0
```
Note that supra numbers are very different from [hyper-dual numbers](http://adl.stanford.edu/hyperdual/): the multiplication operation for supra numbers is noncommutative. In some ways, supra numbers are the dual analog of quaternions.

### rational.InfraComplex

The `rational.InfraComplex` type represents a rational infra complex number. It corresponds to a parabolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Complex` values. The imaginary unit element is denoted `i`, and the dual unit elements are denoted `β` and `γ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = -1
	Mul(β, β) = Mul(γ, γ) = 0
	Mul(β, γ) = Mul(γ, β) = 0
	Mul(i, β) = -Mul(β, i) = γ
	Mul(γ, i) = -Mul(i, γ) = β
```
Note that `i` **does not commute** with either `β` or `γ`. This makes the infra complex numbers different from the more familiar dual complex numbers.

Alternatively, you can obtain the infra complex numbers from an *elliptic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Infra` values.

### rational.InfraPerplex

The `rational.InfraPerplex` type represents a rational infra perplex number. It corresponds to a parabolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Perplex` values. The split unit element is denoted `s`, and the dual unit elements are denoted `τ` and `υ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(s, s) = +1
	Mul(τ, τ) = Mul(υ, υ) = 0
	Mul(τ, υ) = Mul(υ, τ) = 0
	Mul(s, τ) = -Mul(τ, s) = υ
	Mul(s, υ) = -Mul(υ, s) = τ
```
Like `i` in the infra complex numbers, `s` **does not commute** with either `τ` or `υ`. This makes the infra perplex numbers different from the more familiar dual split-complex numbers.

Alternatively, you can obtain the infra perplex numbers from a *hyperbolic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Infra` values.

## Eight-Dimensional Types

There are seven eight-dimensional types. The (binary) multiplication operation for all eight-dimensional types is **noncommutative** and **nonassociative**.

### rational.Cayley

The `rational.Cayley` type represents a rational Cayley octonion. It corresponds to an elliptic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Hamilton` values. The imaginary unit elements are denoted `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `p`, and `q`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = Mul(j, j) = Mul(k, k) = -1
	Mul(m, m) = Mul(n, n) = Mul(p, p) = Mul(q, q) = -1
	Mul(i, j) = -Mul(j, i) = +k
	Mul(i, k) = -Mul(k, i) = -j
	Mul(i, m) = -Mul(m, i) = +n
	Mul(i, n) = -Mul(n, i) = -m
	Mul(i, p) = -Mul(p, i) = -q
	Mul(i, q) = -Mul(q, i) = +p
	Mul(j, k) = -Mul(k, j) = +i
	Mul(j, m) = -Mul(m, j) = +p
	Mul(j, n) = -Mul(n, j) = +q
	Mul(j, p) = -Mul(p, j) = -m
	Mul(j, q) = -Mul(q, j) = -n
	Mul(k, m) = -Mul(m, k) = +q
	Mul(k, n) = -Mul(n, k) = -p
	Mul(k, p) = -Mul(p, k) = +n
	Mul(k, q) = -Mul(q, k) = -m
	Mul(m, n) = -Mul(n, m) = +i
	Mul(m, p) = -Mul(p, m) = +j
	Mul(m, q) = -Mul(q, m) = +k
	Mul(n, p) = -Mul(p, n) = -k
	Mul(n, q) = -Mul(q, n) = +j
	Mul(p, q) = -Mul(q, p) = -i
```
Cayley octonions are [traditional octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion). The type is named after A. Cayley, who was **not** the first person to discover octonions. The first person to discover octonions was J.T. Graves.

This type can be used to study [Gravesian and Kleinian integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion#Integral_octonions), as well as other integral octonions.

### rational.Zorn

The `rational.Zorn` type represents a rational Zorn octonion. It corresponds to a hyperbolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Hamilton` values. The imaginary unit elements are denoted `i`, `j`, and `k`, and the split unit elements are `r`, `s`, `t`, and `u`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = Mul(j, j) = Mul(k, k) = -1
	Mul(r, r) = Mul(s, s) = Mul(t, t) = Mul(u, u) = +1
	Mul(i, j) = -Mul(j, i) = +k
	Mul(i, k) = -Mul(k, i) = -j
	Mul(i, r) = -Mul(r, i) = +s
	Mul(i, s) = -Mul(s, i) = -r

	Mul(j, k) = -Mul(k, j) = +i
	Mul(j, r) = -Mul(r, j) = +t
	Mul(j, s) = -Mul(s, j) = +u
	Mul(j, t) = -Mul(t, j) = -r
	Mul(j, u) = -Mul(u, j) = -s
	Mul(k, r) = -Mul(r, k) = +u
	Mul(k, s) = -Mul(s, k) = -t

	Mul(k, u) = -Mul(u, k) = -r
	Mul(r, s) = -Mul(s, r) = -i
	Mul(r, t) = -Mul(t, r) = -j
	Mul(r, u) = -Mul(u, r) = -k
	Mul(s, t) = -Mul(t, s) = +k
	Mul(s, u) = -Mul(u, s) = -j
	Mul(t, u) = -Mul(u, t) = +i
```
Zorn octonions are commonly known as [split-octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-octonion). The type is named after M.A. Zorn, who developed a vector-matrix algebra for working with split-octonions.

Alternatively, you can obtain the Zorn octonions from an *elliptic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Cockle` values; or from a *hyperbolic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Cockle` values.

## And Beyond...

Using any of the Cayley-Dickson constructs on any of the eight-dimensional types would produce one of nine sixteen-dimensional types. These types include the [sedenions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedenion), which are infamous for containing zero divisors.
