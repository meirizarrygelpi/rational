# rational

Package `rational` brings rational [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number), [split-complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-complex_number), and [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number) numbers to Go. It borrows heavily from the `math`, `math/cmplx`, and `math/big` packages. Indeed, it is built on top of the `big.Rat` type.

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/gojp/goreportcard)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/meirizarrygelpi/rational) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/meirizarrygelpi/rational?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/meirizarrygelpi/rational)

This package contains three two-dimensional types (e.g. complex numbers), five four-dimensional types (e.g. quaternions), and seven eight-dimensional types (e.g. octonions). Each type is either an elliptic, a parabolic, or a hyperbolic Cayley-Dickson construct.

## Cayley-Dickson Constructs

Given elements from what I will call a seed algebra, the Cayley-Dickson construction allows you to build elements of a higher-dimensional algebra with certain interesting properties. Let `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` be elements in the seed algebra. Let `p = (a, b)` and `q = (c, d)` be elements in the construct algebra. Thus,
```go
	Add(p, q) = (Add(a, c), Add(b, d))
```
That is, addition is element-wise. The multiplication operation can be any of three kinds. Before we look into these, we should mention that the seed algebra must also include two involutions, `Conj` and `Neg`, such that the construct algebra also has two involutions `Conj` and `Neg` given by:
```go
	Neg(p) = (Neg(a), Neg(b))
	Conj(p) = (Conj(a), Neg(b))
```
With `Neg` you can define subtraction:
```go
	Sub(p, q) = Add(p, Neg(q))
```
The three multiplication operations are named after conic sections. Each has the form
```go
	Mul(p, q) = (F(a, b, c, d), G(a, b, c, d))
```
With `F` and `G` being a linear combination of bilinear terms.

### Elliptic Multiplication

The **elliptic** multiplication operation is:
```go
	F(a, b, c, d) = Sub(Mul(a, c), Mul(Conj(d), b))
	G(a, b, c, d) = Add(Mul(d, a), Mul(b, Conj(c)))
```
The order of the arguments in all `Mul` calls is very important.

### Parabolic Multiplication

The **parabolic** multiplication operation is:
```go
	F(a, b, c, d) = Mul(a, c)
	G(a, b, c, d) = Add(Mul(d, a), Mul(b, Conj(c)))
```
The order of the arguments in all `Mul` calls is very important. Note that if `a` and `c` are both zero, then `Mul(p, q) = (0, 0)` with `p` and `q` not necessarily being zero. That is, there are zero divisors with this multiplication operation.

### Hyperbolic Multiplication

The **hyperbolic** multiplication operation is:
```go
	F(a, b, c, d) = Add(Mul(a, c), Mul(Conj(d), b))
	G(a, b, c, d) = Add(Mul(d, a), Mul(b, Conj(c)))
```
The order of the arguments in all `Mul` calls is very important. Although it is not obvious, this multiplication operation also leads to zero divisors.

### Non-Sesquilinear Multiplication

The three "conic" multiplication operations above all use the `Conj` involution of the seed algebra. One can also consider non-sesquilinear multiplication rules. If the seed algebra is commutative and associative, then the resulting construct algebra will also be commutative and associative.

The **non-sesquilinear elliptic** multiplication operation is:
```go
	F(a, b, c, d) = Sub(Mul(a, c), Mul(d, b))
	G(a, b, c, d) = Add(Mul(d, a), Mul(b, c))
```
The **non-sesquilinear parabolic** multiplication operation is:
```go
	F(a, b, c, d) = Mul(a, c)
	G(a, b, c, d) = Add(Mul(d, a), Mul(b, c))
```
The **non-sesquilinear hyperbolic** multiplication operation is:
```go
	F(a, b, c, d) = Add(Mul(a, c), Mul(d, b))
	G(a, b, c, d) = Add(Mul(d, a), Mul(b, c))
```
The resulting construct algebras are very different from the familiar Cayley-Dickson constructs.

## Two-Dimensional Types

There are three two-dimensional types. The (binary) multiplication operation for all two-dimensional types is **commutative** and **associative**.

### rational.Complex

The `rational.Complex` type represents a rational complex number. It corresponds to an elliptic Cayley-Dickson construct with `big.Rat` values. The imaginary unit element is denoted `i`. The multiplication rule is:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = -1
```
This type can be used to study [Gaussian integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integer).

### rational.Perplex

The `rational.Perplex` type represents a rational perplex number. It corresponds to a hyperbolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `big.Rat` values. The split unit element is denoted `s`. The multiplication rule is:
```go
	Mul(s, s) = +1
```
Perplex numbers are more commonly known as [split-complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-complex_number), but "perplex" is used here for brevity and symmetry with "complex".

### rational.Infra

The `rational.Infra` type represents a rational infra number. It corresponds to a parabolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `big.Rat` values. The dual unit element is denoted `α`. The multiplication rule is:
```go
	Mul(α, α) = 0
```
Infra numbers are useful for computing numerical first-order derivatives. If `z = a + 1α`, and `f` is a function, then
```
	f(z) = f(a) + f'(a)α
```
Infra numbers are more commonly known as [dual numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number), but "infra" is used here along with "supra" and "ultra" for the higher-dimensional analogs.

## Four-Dimensional Types

There are five four-dimensional types. The (binary) multiplication operation for all four-dimensional types is **noncommutative** but **associative**.

### rational.Hamilton

The `rational.Hamilton` type represents a rational Hamilton quaternion. It corresponds to an elliptic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Complex` values. The imaginary unit elements are denoted `i`, `j`, and `k`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = Mul(j, j) = Mul(k, k) = -1
	Mul(i, j) = -Mul(j, i) = k
	Mul(j, k) = -Mul(k, j) = i
	Mul(k, i) = -Mul(i, k) = j
```
Hamilton quaternions are [traditional quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion). The type is named after W.R. Hamilton, who discovered quaternions.

This type can be used to study [Hurwitz and Lipschitz integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz_quaternion).

### rational.Cockle

The `rational.Cockle` type represents a rational Cockle quaternion. It corresponds to a hyperbolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Complex` values. The imaginary unit element is denoted `i`, and the split unit elements are denoted `t` and `u`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = -1
	Mul(t, t) = Mul(u, u) = +1
	Mul(i, t) = -Mul(t, i) = u
	Mul(u, t) = -Mul(t, u) = i
	Mul(u, i) = -Mul(i, u) = t
```
Cockle quaternions are more commonly known as [split-quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-quaternion). The type is named after J. Cockle, who discovered them.

Alternatively, you can obtain the Cockle quaternions from an *elliptic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Perplex` values; or from a *hyperbolic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Perplex` values.

### rational.Supra

The `rational.Supra` type represents a rational supra number. It corresponds to a parabolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Infra` values. The dual unit elements are denoted `α`, `β`, and `γ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(α, α) = Mul(β, β) = Mul(γ, γ) = 0
	Mul(α, β) = -Mul(β, α) = γ
	Mul(β, γ) = Mul(γ, β) = 0
	Mul(γ, α) = Mul(α, γ) = 0
```
Note that supra numbers are very different from [hyper-dual numbers](http://adl.stanford.edu/hyperdual/): the multiplication operation for supra numbers is noncommutative. In some ways, supra numbers are the dual analog of quaternions.

### rational.InfraComplex

The `rational.InfraComplex` type represents a rational infra complex number. It corresponds to a parabolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Complex` values. The imaginary unit element is denoted `i`, and the dual unit elements are denoted `β` and `γ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = -1
	Mul(β, β) = Mul(γ, γ) = 0
	Mul(β, γ) = Mul(γ, β) = 0
	Mul(i, β) = -Mul(β, i) = γ
	Mul(γ, i) = -Mul(i, γ) = β
```
Note that `i` **does not commute** with either `β` or `γ`. This makes the infra complex numbers different from the more familiar dual complex numbers.

Alternatively, you can obtain the infra complex numbers from an *elliptic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Infra` values.

### rational.InfraPerplex

The `rational.InfraPerplex` type represents a rational infra perplex number. It corresponds to a parabolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Perplex` values. The split unit element is denoted `s`, and the dual unit elements are denoted `τ` and `υ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(s, s) = +1
	Mul(τ, τ) = Mul(υ, υ) = 0
	Mul(τ, υ) = Mul(υ, τ) = 0
	Mul(s, τ) = -Mul(τ, s) = υ
	Mul(s, υ) = -Mul(υ, s) = τ
```
Like `i` in the infra complex numbers, `s` **does not commute** with either `τ` or `υ`. This makes the infra perplex numbers different from the more familiar dual split-complex numbers.

Alternatively, you can obtain the infra perplex numbers from a *hyperbolic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Infra` values.

## Eight-Dimensional Types

There are seven eight-dimensional types. The (binary) multiplication operation for all eight-dimensional types is **noncommutative** and **nonassociative**.

### rational.Cayley

The `rational.Cayley` type represents a rational Cayley octonion. It corresponds to an elliptic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Hamilton` values. The imaginary unit elements are denoted `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `p`, and `q`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = Mul(j, j) = Mul(k, k) = -1
	Mul(m, m) = Mul(n, n) = Mul(p, p) = Mul(q, q) = -1
	Mul(i, j) = -Mul(j, i) = +k
	Mul(i, k) = -Mul(k, i) = -j
	Mul(i, m) = -Mul(m, i) = +n
	Mul(i, n) = -Mul(n, i) = -m
	Mul(i, p) = -Mul(p, i) = -q
	Mul(i, q) = -Mul(q, i) = +p
	Mul(j, k) = -Mul(k, j) = +i
	Mul(j, m) = -Mul(m, j) = +p
	Mul(j, n) = -Mul(n, j) = +q
	Mul(j, p) = -Mul(p, j) = -m
	Mul(j, q) = -Mul(q, j) = -n
	Mul(k, m) = -Mul(m, k) = +q
	Mul(k, n) = -Mul(n, k) = -p
	Mul(k, p) = -Mul(p, k) = +n
	Mul(k, q) = -Mul(q, k) = -m
	Mul(m, n) = -Mul(n, m) = +i
	Mul(m, p) = -Mul(p, m) = +j
	Mul(m, q) = -Mul(q, m) = +k
	Mul(n, p) = -Mul(p, n) = -k
	Mul(n, q) = -Mul(q, n) = +j
	Mul(p, q) = -Mul(q, p) = -i
```
Cayley octonions are [traditional octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion). The type is named after A. Cayley, who was **not** the first person to discover octonions. The first person to discover octonions was J.T. Graves.

This type can be used to study [Gravesian and Kleinian integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion#Integral_octonions), as well as other integral octonions.

### rational.Zorn

The `rational.Zorn` type represents a rational Zorn octonion. It corresponds to a hyperbolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Hamilton` values. The imaginary unit elements are denoted `i`, `j`, and `k`, and the split unit elements are `r`, `s`, `t`, and `u`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = Mul(j, j) = Mul(k, k) = -1
	Mul(r, r) = Mul(s, s) = Mul(t, t) = Mul(u, u) = +1
	Mul(i, j) = -Mul(j, i) = +k
	Mul(i, k) = -Mul(k, i) = -j
	Mul(i, r) = -Mul(r, i) = +s
	Mul(i, s) = -Mul(s, i) = -r
	Mul(i, t) = -Mul(t, i) = -u
	Mul(i, u) = -Mul(u, i) = +t
	Mul(j, k) = -Mul(k, j) = +i
	Mul(j, r) = -Mul(r, j) = +t
	Mul(j, s) = -Mul(s, j) = +u
	Mul(j, t) = -Mul(t, j) = -r

	Mul(k, s) = -Mul(s, k) = -t
	Mul(k, t) = -Mul(t, k) = +s
	Mul(k, u) = -Mul(u, k) = -r
	Mul(r, s) = -Mul(s, r) = -i
	Mul(r, t) = -Mul(t, r) = -j
	Mul(r, u) = -Mul(u, r) = -k
	Mul(s, t) = -Mul(t, s) = +k
	Mul(s, u) = -Mul(u, s) = -j
	Mul(t, u) = -Mul(u, t) = +i
```
Zorn octonions are commonly known as [split-octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-octonion). The type is named after M.A. Zorn, who developed a vector-matrix algebra for working with split-octonions.

Alternatively, you can obtain the Zorn octonions from an *elliptic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Cockle` values; or from a *hyperbolic* Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Cockle` values.

### rational.Ultra

The `rational.Ultra` type represents a rational ultra number. It corresponds to a parabolic Cayley-Dickson construct with `rational.Supra` values. The dual unit elements are denoted `α`, `β`, `γ`, `δ`, `ε`, `ζ`, and `η`. The multiplication rules are:

## And Beyond...

Using any of the Cayley-Dickson constructs on any of the eight-dimensional types would produce one of nine sixteen-dimensional types. These types include the [sedenions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedenion), which are infamous for containing zero divisors.

## Other Types

Besides all the types mentioned above, other types are included. These types have multiplication operations that do not involve conjugation.

	Mul(S, S) = +1
	Mul(i, J) = Mul(J, i) = +S
	Mul(J, S) = Mul(S, J) = -i

The `rational.Hyper` type represents a hyper-dual number. It corresponds to a non-sesquilinear parabolic construct with `rational.Infra` values. The dual units are denoted `α`, `κ`, and `λ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(α, α) = Mul(κ, κ) = Mul(λ, λ) = 0
	Mul(α, κ) = Mul(κ, α) = λ
	Mul(κ, λ) = Mul(λ, κ) = 0
	Mul(λ, α) = Mul(α, λ) = 0
```
Note that this multiplication operation is **commutative** and **associative**.

Hyper-dual numbers are useful for computing second-order derivatives. If `z = a + 1α + 1κ + 0λ`, and `f` is a function, then
```
	f(z) = f(a) + f'(a)α + f'(a)κ + f''(a)λ
```
Another name for the dual numbers could be the *nilplex* numbers. Thus, in analogy with the bicomplex numbers, another name for the hyper-dual numbers could be the *binilplex* numbers.

### rational.DualComplex

The `rational.DualComplex` type represents a dual-complex number. It corresponds to a non-sesquilinear parabolic construct with `rational.Complex` values. The imaginary unit is denoted `i`, and the dual units are denoted `κ` and `λ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(i, i) = -1
	Mul(κ, κ) = Mul(λ, λ) = 0
	Mul(i, κ) = Mul(κ, i) = +λ
	Mul(κ, λ) = Mul(λ, κ) = 0
	Mul(λ, i) = Mul(i, λ) = -κ
```
Note that this multiplication operation is **commutative** and **associative**.

Dual-complex numbers are useful for evaluating two-dimensional vector derivatives. Let `(x, y)` be the coordinate vector in a two-dimensional space. Also, let `f = (g, h)` be a function vector. Then, the **divergence** and the **curl** of `f` are:
```go
	Div(f) = (∂g / ∂x) + (∂h / ∂y)
	Curl(f) = (∂h / ∂x) - (∂g / ∂y)
```
A two-dimensional vector `(x, y)` can be associated with a complex number `z = x + yi`. Introduce the Wirtinger derivative
```
	(∂ / ∂z) = (1 / 2) * ((∂ / ∂x) - (∂ / ∂y)i)
```
The function vector `(g, h)` becomes the complex number `f = g + hi`. Then:
```
	2 * (∂f / ∂z) = Div(f) + (Curl(f))i
```
Thus, in analogy with the dual numbers, given a dual-complex number `p = a + bi + 2κ + 0λ`, and a function `f`, then
```
	f(p) = f(a + bi) + (∂f / ∂z) * (2κ + 0λ)
		 = f(a + bi) + (Div(f))κ + (Curl(f))λ
```
In this manner, `f`, `Div(f)`, and `Curl(f)` can be calculated at the point `a + bi` by just evaluating `f(a + bi + 2κ + 0λ)`. Note that this derivation assumes that `f` is holomorphic (i.e. that it only depends on `a` and `b` in the combination `a + bi`).

### rational.DualPerplex

The `rational.DualPerplex` type represents a dual-perplex number. It corresponds to a non-sesquilinear parabolic construct with `rational.Perplex` values. The split unit is denoted `s`, and the dual units are denoted `κ` and `λ`. The multiplication rules are:
```go
	Mul(s, s) = +1
	Mul(κ, κ) = Mul(λ, λ) = 0
	Mul(s, κ) = Mul(κ, s) = +λ
	Mul(κ, λ) = Mul(λ, κ) = 0
	Mul(λ, s) = Mul(s, λ) = +κ
```
Note that this multiplication operation is **commutative** and **associative**.

Just like dual-complex numbers, the dual-perplex numbers can be used to evaluate certain vector derivatives. Let `w = x + ys` and `f = g + hs`. The Wirtinger derivative is now
```
	(∂ / ∂w) = (1 / 2) * ((∂ / ∂x) + (∂ / ∂y)s)
```
Then:
```
	2 * (∂f / ∂w) = ((∂g / ∂x) + (∂h / ∂y)) + ((∂h / ∂x) + (∂g / ∂y))s
```
This suggests the introduction of the hyperbolic version of the curl:
```
	Hurl(f) = (∂h / ∂x) + (∂g / ∂y)
```
Now let `p = a + bs + 2κ + 0λ`. Thus,
```
	f(p) = f(a + bs) + (Div(f))κ + (Hurl(f))λ
```
Again, `f`, `Div(f)`, and now `Hurl(f)` can be calculated at the point `a + bs` by just evaluating `f(a + bs + 2κ + 0λ)`.
